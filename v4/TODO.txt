what if input is 0 or 1? -> can it still sort? -> kinda answered by line 7?!?!?

remove <stdio.h>

why does it work for 1 input if I don't check for argc < 3?

FIX NORM_ERRORS!!!

check if all the operations are working properly

fix is_int -> does not display error when >INT is not first parameter

do I have to take single strings delimited by spaces as well????
